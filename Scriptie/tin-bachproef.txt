Introduction
“If you think that the internet has
changed your life, think again. The
IoT is about to change it all over
again!”
Brendan O’Brien

The Internet of Things hasn’t been around for a very long time, yet it’s quickly
becoming very popular and almost every tech company wants to be a part of it. It
gained a lot of popularity around 2011 when IPV6 was released and it was around this
time Gartner also took note of this trend and put it on their annual Hype Cycle for the
first time. Around the same time of the growing popularity of the Internet of Things,
the Bluetooth Special Interest Group released a new Bluetooth specification that was
built for the Internet of Things: Bluetooth Low Energy. Gartner suggests that by
2020, around 20 billion ‘things’ will be connected to the Internet of Things, a market
that Bluetooth Low Energy wants to play a big role in. This thesis aims to provide
an introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy and how one would go about connecting
Bluetooth Low Energy to the Internet of Things. In this chapter the problem that the
thesis is trying to find an answer for is elaborated, as well as the actual questions that
need answering. An introduction about ‘AllThingsTalk’ can also be found, a company
that is trying to figure out how to connect Bluetooth Low Energy wearables with their
Internet of Things infrastructure.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

1.1

Problem statement and research questions

In this section, the goal is to quickly familiarize the reader with the subject this thesis
is dealing about and which problems need to be solved in order to form a proper conclusion. First of all, the problem statement will be discussed where a quick sketch will
be made as to why this thesis came to be. It will handle a subject that AllThingsTalk
is very keen to discover for the development of their company and why combining
Bluetooth Low Energy with their Internet of Things infrastructure is the next logical
step for their business. Next, we’ll look at the main question AllThingsTalk wants an
answer for together with some smaller questions that logically follow it.

1.1.1

Problem statement

At the time of writing, there are already a lot of Bluetooth enabled products on the
technology market. With the new Bluetooth Low Energy specification, Bluetooth is
reaching out even further to products like socks1 , shoes2 , fitness bands3 and more are
being added to the list every day. The problem with these products is that in a lot of
cases, the products only synchronize with a smartphone. Some manufacturers extend
this connectivity by occasionally synchronizing the data the smartphone captures to
their own proprietary cloud, where the data can be analyzed by both the company and
the consumer. Most of the time, this is where the data cycle stops and it can’t be
further accessed by other parties, this is known as a closed loop system. In some cases,
developers can still access the data with an API that communicates with the cloud
service of the manufacturer, but this doesn’t give any access to the raw sensor values
and doesn’t allow real-time data transfer. An example of a closed system versus open
system can be found in figure 1.1.
On top of this, a lot of the devices being manufactured don’t use standard SIG
adopted BLE services, which makes interoperability with existing applications hard, if
not impossible if authentication and encryption are added into the mix.

1.1.2

Research questions

There are a couple of questions that can be asked when combining Bluetooth Low
Energy and the Internet of Things, and some of those questions alone could have
multiple papers dedicated to them. For example, the matter of security will be a
never ending debate, and even more concerns arise when talking about security in the
Internet of Things. Another concern is privacy, but since this is very much a gray area,

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Figure 1.1: Image demonstrating a closed system (left) versus an open system (right).
A closed system usually has its own (optional) cloud for every device from a different
manufacturer, only pushing data but not pulling it. It also (not always) exposes a Web
API to allow users to pull the data to their computer. An open system exposes one
public cloud like the AllThingsTalk cloud with one Web API, also allowing 2-way data
communication between smartphone and cloud.
it’s hard to formulate a one-sided conclusion on this matter. Some of these concerns
will be addressed further in section 9.2.
The main goals this thesis tries to fulfil are in essence very simple, but of course
there are always some other questions that arise when looking at the big picture. These
questions can be categorized as following, the questions in bold being the main research
questions and the ones in plain text being auxiliary questions:
• Can Bluetooth Low Energy wearables be used in an Internet of Things
cloud infrastructure?
• Is is possible to use a smartphone as gateway to communicate with the
AllThingsTalk cloud in real-time?
• What is Bluetooth Low Energy?
• What is the difference between Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Classic?

• What are the pros and cons of this technology?
• What types of devices exist in Bluetooth Low Energy and how do they expose
their data?

1.2

AllThingsTalk

As you’ve probably already noticed, the company AllThingsTalk has been referenced
a couple of times in the previous section. The reason for this is that this thesis is
affiliated with the company and is being written for them. The company helped shape
the vision of the thesis and offered some very interesting insights and ideas for subjects
to write about, subjects which were very interesting for their own use.
AllThingsTalk was founded in July 2013 and their main objective is to ‘Make IoT
ideas happen’. The company is already counting thirteen employees in two different
countries, the headquarters being located in Ghent, Belgium. The office in Belgium
counts seven people and is heavily focused on research & development engineering,
project management and sales & marketing. The branch office is located in Belgrade,
Serbia with the other six people, and their main focus is platform software development.

1.2.1

History

AllThingsTalk has come a long way since the start of the company. They’ve received multiple Research & Innovation grants from the government, the first being in
September 2013 for building an open IoT platform: the AllThingsTalk Cloud. The
second grant was received in May 2014, where the goal was to implement pattern
recognition in their platform in order to help elderly people stay in their homes for a
longer time. A third grant was acquired in February 2015, which was responsible for
adding machine learning components to the platform.
Furthermore, they’ve hit some other major milestones throughout the years. In
November 2014 they launched the first set of Rapid Development Kits for Internet
of Things, where they added the Intel Rapid Development Kit in April 2015 and the
LoRa Rapid Development Kit in November 2015. Other milestones include Internet of
Things hackathons, the launch of IOTOPIA.be - a platform to introduce children in
secondary schools to Internet of Things - and a LoRa partnership with Proximus, one
of the largest telecommunications companies in Belgium.

Methodology
“Research is formalized curiosity. It
is poking and prying with a
purpose.”
Zora Neale Hurston

This chapter aims to explain what approaches and methods were used in the making
of this thesis. It explains what methods were used for the two major parts of this thesis,
being the research & literature study and the Proof of Concept.

2.1

Research and literature study

Before starting the research, the most important question was ‘what does AllThingsTalk
already know?’. Of course, being a company revolving around Internet of Things, it
wouldn’t be much use to dedicate a large section of this paper to it. However, some
research had to be done about Internet of Things in order to understand some core
concepts and technologies that are used like transfer protocols such as MQTT and
AMQP. A more abstract understanding was also needed, being how the Internet of
Things works, what it’s used for, why it’s important and some more. This information
is of course easily found online and wasn’t of much use to include in this thesis.
That being said, the core subject of the research and literature study is about Bluetooth Low Energy. The research about this technology was done like you would research
any other subject. Initially, the plan was to rely heavily on the official documentation
of Bluetooth, but since the complete Bluetooth specification is over 2000 pages in
length, a more practical approach was to purchase books that explain Bluetooth Low
Energy, two of them being REFERENTIE BOEK 1 and REFERENTIE BOEK 2.
There are also training videos to be found on the Bluetooth website as well as
various other short introductions to the technology all over the web, which provide a
9

CHAPTER 2. METHODOLOGY
basic and quick understanding about the technology.

2.2

Proof of Concept

You don’t get to know something without actually trying it out, which was one of the
biggest focuses of the Proof of Concept. The actual goal of the Proof of Concept
was more to provide the Bluetooth Low Energy layer than to connect to the Internet,
as AllThingsTalk provides easy-to-use libraries in various language to connect to their
platform.
In order to help speed up the learning process and quickly allow me to prototype and
try out the technology, various devices were provided which offer a range of Bluetooth
Low Energy profiles, services and characteristics, these terms are explained further in
chapter 6. These devices will shortly be introduced in chapter 8.
The first goal of the Proof of Concept was to connect to a Bluetooth Low Energy
device and read data on a smartphone. Various examples and repositories with source
code provided some interesting insights as to how this API worked. Bluetooth also
offers some starter kits to kickstart any project that wants to use Bluetooth Low
Energy, including a very comprehensive and easy to use wrapper around the Android
Bluetooth API.
Further goals of course include writing data and coupling the Bluetooth layer to
the network layer, automatic service discovery and mapping, automatic generation of
assets on the online platform and more. The most important concepts on how to do
this are elaborated in chapter 8 and the accomplishments are listed in the conclusion,
section 9.1.

Chapter 3
Bluetooth Low Energy
“Bluetooth Low Energy is going to
change the way the world connects.”
Robin Heydon

Bluetooth has been around for a long time, and with the release of technologies
like NFC it seemed like Bluetooth wasn’t going to last for much longer. However,
Bluetooth Low Energy has breathed new life into Bluetooth and it’s now more popular
than ever. Originally known as Wibree by Nokia, it was later merged into the Bluetooth
standard after much consideration. This technology was built from the ground up to
be as energy efficient as possible and will power the Internet of Things for years to
come. Exciting updates are also on the way like mesh networking, allowing different
nodes in a network to relay data to one another. In this chapter we’ll be looking at
what Bluetooth Low Energy actually is, what the key differences are between Bluetooth
BR/EDR and Bluetooth Low Energy. Also worth investigating are the limitations of
Bluetooth Low Energy and how this technology achieves low energy like no other.

11

CHAPTER 3. BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY

3.1

What is Bluetooth Low Energy

In essence, Bluetooth Low Energy is the first open standard that consumes extremely
low power. It has been built from scratch and has more things not in common than it
does with Bluetooth, so the name can be a little bit confusing. Every component in
this specification has been designed to consume as little power as possible, that’s why
this technology can also be called a ‘Coin cell’ technology. This because a Bluetooth
Low Energy enabled device can (theoretically, with normal usage) achieve battery life
of around eight months on a coin cell battery. A great example of this are beacons,
which can achieve a very long battery life if configured correctly. If fitted with a bigger
battery, it can last for over two years. More information about the battery usage and
how this low energy is achieved can be found in section 3.4.
However, you might be thinking: if Bluetooth Low Energy is so great, why isn’t
it replacing other wireless technologies? The main reason for this is because it’s very
slow and has very little range. A couple of other limitations are present, but these
will be more closely looked at in subsecion 3.2.2. Bluetooth Low Energy’s main use is
intended for Personal Area Networks, with a gateway in range that can relay data to
a cloud service in order to connect various devices to the internet.

3.2

Key differences between classic Bluetooth

As the diligent reader probably already noticed, it seems that Bluetooth and Bluetooth
Low Energy are worlds apart from one another. This is in fact very correct so it’s hard
to just list some differences and be done with it. In the next two subsections we’ll
look at why Bluetooth Low Energy is completely different from Bluetooth and should
be seen as a new technology in its whole instead of an enhancement to the existing
Bluetooth. The key limitations of the Bluetooth Low Energy specification are also
addressed further in subsection 3.2.2.

3.2.1

A new technology emerges

A lot of authors are looking to compare Bluetooth with Bluetooth Low Energy, but
this is an unfair comparison since the use cases for both of these technologies are
completely different. As the name suggests, Bluetooth Low Energy is marketed for
low energy devices like wearables and sensors, so it isn’t here to replace other wireless
technologies in the slightest where a continuous flow of data is required. They’ve also
both been built around completely different core principles and have been designed to
fulfil these requirements as best as possible.
12

CHAPTER 3. BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY

3.2.2

Limitations of Bluetooth Low Energy

Bluetooth Low Energy doesn’t bring all good news, but there are also a few key limitations to the technology, as with everything in life. Because the technology uses very
little power, it’s fairly easy to understand that the transmit power and transfer speeds
aren’t anywhere near other wireless technologies. In theory, Bluetooth Low Energy can
achieve ranges of up to 65 meters and upcoming updates to the specification prove
that this range will be increased even more. However, most manufacturers won’t want
their peripheral to transmit at such high range, because this will cause increased battery usage in turn. In practice, this range is of course much lower, as walls and even
humans wreak havoc on the transmission of data.
Another limitation is the transfer speed. Again, in theory, Bluetooth Low Energy
can have a (full packet) transfer speed of up to 1 Mbps1 . If you take into account
the actual data contained in said packet and add up all of the overhead that goes into
transferring a packet, 5 to 10 KB per second is a much more realistic representation.
Knowing this, it’s safe to assume that Bluetooth Low Energy won’t be replacing WiFi
any time soon.

3.3

Bluetooth configurations

Bluetooth Low Energy is known by a variety of names on the market and while some
of them are used to describe the same technology, in a few there’s some differences to
be found. ‘Bluetooth Low Energy’ is mostly used as a catch-all name and can consist
of a few different configurations. Some people assume ‘classic’ or Bluetooth BR/EDR
is also Bluetooth Low Energy, but this assumption couldn’t be more wrong. If you
have a product that specifies that you must have Bluetooth Version 4.0 or later, you’re
probably dealing with a Bluetooth Low Energy product.
Other names that can commonly be found are Bluetooth Smart (single-mode)
and Bluetooth Smart Ready (dual-mode), these are both specifications of Bluetooth
Low Energy but have one key difference between each other: backwards compatibility.
Bluetooth Smart has been designed to only allow interoperability between itself and
Bluetooth Smart Ready products. You’ll usually see this configuration in wearable
devices that connect to a smart phone, in this case the wearable is a Bluetooth Smart
product and the smartphone is a Bluetooth Smart Ready product. Bluetooth Smart
Ready on the other hand has been designed to allow communication with Bluetooth,
Bluetooth Smart Ready and Bluetooth Smart products. Bluetooth Smart Ready is
commonly present in the most recent smartphones, which will allow communication
with Bluetooth products like headphones but also Bluetooth Smart products like a
1

1 Mbps equals to 100 kilobytes per second.

found in table 3.1.

3.4

How low energy is achieved

There are a couple of techniques Bluetooth Low Energy uses to achieve low energy
consumption. The fact alone that it can run off a 3 volt CR2032 coin cell battery and
still retain 8 months of battery life proves that it is indeed a true low energy technology.
There are a couple of decisions that made it possible to achieve this low amount of
energy consumption, some being the following:
• Use the radio as little as possible. Keeping the radio on any wireless technology active requires quite a bit of power, which is also the case with Bluetooth
Low Energy. By using the radio as little as possible, Bluetooth Low Energy can
significantly increase its battery life. At a set interval, devices will broadcast
advertising packets on the three advertising channels, which are explained more
in section 5.2. After it advertises, it must listen briefly to any connection requests that follow it, in between these events the radio is simply turned off. The
radio and the protocol stack, explained more in depth in chapter 4, have also
been designed to be as fast as possible. An advertising event, connection event,
reading a single value of data and acknowledging the event can take as little as
3 milliseconds, which is vital in not only keeping the energy consumption to a
minimum, but it also helps passively cool the radio.
• Keep packets very small. Restricting the packet length to a maximum of 47
bytes allows very rapid packet transfers, which in turn contributes to keeping
the radio off as much as possible. A maximum size packet of 47 bytes can be
transferred in as little as 0.3 milliseconds. Keeping packets small also lowers
the complexity of the transmitter and receiver, resulting in much lower power
consumption than technologies that allow large packets.

Generic Access Profile
“I NEED TO LOOK UP A QUOTE
FOR THIS CHAPTER”
Jan Van Braeckel

One of the most important parts in Bluetooth Low Energy, if not most important
one, is the Generic Access Profile. This profile determines everything from advertising
device presence to continuing to a connection. It specifies rules how devices can and
must behave in order to interact with one another and imposes some general rules both
devices have to follow. It also supports some modes and procedures to secure the data
link, like authentication, bonding, authorization and encryption. In this chapter, we’ll
look at some general information about the Generic Access Profile like device roles
and data channels before taking a look at how advertising, scanning, broadcasting and
connections work.

CHAPTER 5. GENERIC ACCESS PROFILE

5.1

Roles

Every Bluetooth Low Energy device has a one or more roles it can fulfil. Each of
these roles have been optimized to perform their task as best it can. First of all
there’s the Broadcaster role, which only requires a device to have a transmitter and
advertising profile. Broadcasters aren’t necessarily devices that you can connect to, so
manufacturing broadcast only devices could cut down on cost even more as there’s no
need to have a receiver on these devices. An example of this is a thermostat which
constantly broadcasts its temperature.
Secondly there’s the Observers, these devices are opposite to broadcasters as they
don’t require a transmitter. Observers just listen to advertising events and process the
data further, without ever making a connection. These devices make perfect gateways
for Observers, as a connection will never occur between these two, and the observer
can just relay the data to an other collection point.
The last two types of roles are Peripherals and Centrals. These two are the most
complex roles as both devices are required to have both a transmitter and receiver. The
big difference however is that a Peripheral will always act as a slave in a connection and
a Central will always act as a master. This also means that the peripheral will (most
of the time) be the least powerful device with the lowest battery life, like a watch or
a sensor. It’s vital that Peripheral devices don’t do the heavy lifting in connections
because this would drain the battery too quickly. The Central in a connection is usually
a much more powerful device with a better battery life, like a smartphone, tablet or
even computers.

5.2

Data channels

Bluetooth Low Energy uses a number of channels in the 2.4 GHz ISM frequency
band. Some of these channels are used for advertising and most of them are used for
transferring data once a connection has been made. In total 40 channels are used, 3
of which are used for advertising and the remaining 37 are used for connections. The
frequency range starts at 2402 and ends at 2483.5, giving each frequency a range of
about 2 MHz to operate on. These channels have been carefully picked to have the least
interference possible from WiFi on the advertising channels. Since every connection
starts with advertisements it’s vital that these packets flow without interference. A
visualization of these channels can be found in figure 5.1.
In order to make sure that connection packets flow as frequently as possible without
having too many dropped packets, Bluetooth Low Energy uses adaptive frequency
hopping. This means that at a set interval that the master and slave negotiate with
each other, they will switch frequency with a known algorithm, ensuring they’ll always
end up in the same frequency band. If data doesn’t make it through on a given channel,
18

CHAPTER 5. GENERIC ACCESS PROFILE
the frequency hop will occur prematurely and both master and slave will move on to
the next frequency and resend the packet(s) that weren’t acknowledged.

Figure 5.1: Image visualizing the Bluetooth Low Energy channel spectrum. The green
channels are advertising channels while the remaining 37 are used for connections. LL
stands for the corresponding number that the link layer assigns to these channels.

5.3

Advertising

As quoted a few times before, advertising is one of the most important procedures
in Bluetooth Low Energy. A device can be built solely around advertising data, but
no device can work without it. Its main purpose is to broadcast the device is present
and active so devices can connect with it if the device is connectable, but it can be
used for more than that. A typical device will constantly be advertising its state to
other devices. This state can be device name, device address and even an (incomplete)
list of available services on the device. The advertising interval differs from device to
device, but it’s easy to conclude that a device with a faster advertising interval will
drain battery more quickly than one with a slow advertising interval.
If the device can’t fit enough data into the advertising packet, there is a second option to send more data without requiring a connection. Once a device receives an advertising packet, it can send out a Scan Request, acknowledging that
it received the previous advertising packet and is listening for extra packets if there
are any. The peripheral can then proceed to send a Scan Response with extra data.
It’s important to note however that a peripheral that uses Scan Requests isn’t connectable,
which means that it’s perfect for a beacon or any sort of other advertising device. SOURCE

5.3.1

Data format

As discussed in subsection 4.1.2, each packet, be it advertising or data, has the same
maximum length and structure but the data part of the packet is filled depending on
the type of packet that is sent. The data in an advertising packet is filled with AD
Types which take up one byte, and the data for that AD Type which is of variable
19

CHAPTER 5. GENERIC ACCESS PROFILE
length. An incomplete list of these AD Types together with their definition is found
below. A full list of AD Types together with their descriptions can be found on the
Bluetooth website1 and Bluetooth Core Specification.
• List of Service Class UUIDs (0x02 - 0x07): Helps with finding out the purpose
of a device, can contain a complete or partial list of available services on the
device.
• Shortened or Complete Local Name (0x08 & 0x09): Usually gives a friendly
name to a device in UTF-8 format.
• Service Data (0x16): Represents a GATT service and the data associated with
it, this is in essence how a broadcasting only device transfers data.
• Appearance (0x19): Contains a number representing the external appearance.
This can be anything from “Generic Keyring” to “Joystick”.
• Indoor Positioning (0x25): Helps with mapping BLE devices in a building, can
contain coordinates, altitude, floor number and location name.
• Advertising Interval (0x1A): How often the device advertises its presence.

5.4

Broadcasting

As discussed in the Advertising section (5.3), it’s possible to have a device that only
advertises data and isn’t connectable, or its main purpose doesn’t rely on connections.
This is known as a broadcast device and can be used in broadcasting network topologies.
Take for example a radio station, it simply broadcasts its data and it doesn’t really
matter how many people are listening. When broadcasting, you don’t care how many
devices can be listening to your data and you shouldn’t care about security when
advertising data. A great example of this are beacons, which broadcast a very simple
payload telling they’re there. Infinite amount of devices can listen in on this data
communication and use it for their own. Once you need to send sensitive data or only
want two-way communication, a connection must be established which uses the GATT
Profile to exchange data between master and slave. More information on GATT can
be found in chapter 6.

CHAPTER 5. GENERIC ACCESS PROFILE

5.5

Connections

Once a central is ready to connect to a peripheral, it sends a connection request to
the peripheral. The peripheral can then accept or deny the request and once accepted,
the connection sequence can begin. During the establishment of a connection, a few
key rules are established that will stay in place for the remainder of that connection
or until both devices agree to change the connection parameters. These rules can be
hop frequency, hop amount, what to do when the connection fails and more. Some of
these parameters can be changed during the connection lifetime, an example of this is
given in section 5.2, where the devices can agree to avoid a given channel for a certain
time because there’s too much interference. Once a connection has been established,
the peripheral will stop advertising its presence since it can only be connected to one
central. For the remainder of that connection, both master and slave will exchange data
solely with GATT until the connection terminates. The peripheral will then continue
once again to advertise its presence.

Generic Attribute Profile
“You can have data without
information, but you cannot have
information without data.”
Daniel Keys Moran

At the core of Bluetooth Low Energy communication, the Generic Attribute Profile
or GATT is something a client will use in every data request or data push once a
dedicated connection has been set up. It defines the way data is transferred in Bluetooth Low Energy and it uses the Attribute protocol, which is the protocol that stores
Services, Characteristics, Descriptors and their respective values. In this chapter the
general Attribute Profile and Protocol will be discussed, as well as the different data
structures that come in to play. An example of an Attribute server will also be given
using a standard SIG-approved Profile, as well as why and how one would implement
their own Profile, either because the SIG-approved Profiles don’t fit the use case or
because the manufacturer wants to make the used technology more private.

22

CHAPTER 6. GENERIC ATTRIBUTE PROFILE

6.1

Profiles

Profiles in Bluetooth Low Energy are an abstract representation of how a device can
be implemented to fill a specific use case. These profiles are purely an example of
how things can be done and these can be extended as you want or you can start from
scratch and define your own profile. The Heart Rate profile for example defines that
the device uses a minimum of two services: the Heart Rate Service and the optional
Device Information Service. Its role is a Heart Rate Sensor and it serves as a collector,
collecting data and then broadcasting it or sending it to a connected master device.

6.2

Services

All data in Bluetooth Low Energy is accessed through services. You can compare
it to simple Object Oriented principles: a service has multiple characteristics and a
characteristic belongs to one single service. An example of this is the Bluetooth SIG
defined Heart Rate Service. This document defines the way the Heart Rate Service is
used and what characteristics are contained in the service. For example, the Heart Rate
Service defines 3 characteristics: Heart Rate Measurement, Body Sensor Location and
Heart Rate Control Point, only the Heart Rate Measurement is mandatory to include.
A device can host any number of services which are independent of one another.
Every service also has its own security options which you can customize. You can set
options like encryption for individual services or the device as a whole.
Apart from multiple primary services, a service can also be contained in a parent
service, this is then known as a secondary service. However, the secondary service
system isn’t encountered that often, but it can be useful at times. Take for example
a device which has two temperature sensors, one for the outside temperature and
one for the battery temperature. The manufacturer could then choose to include the
temperature service for the battery as a secondary service of the battery service, this
avoids ambiguity.
Apart from the SIG-defined services, a custom service can be designed if the defined
services don’t meet the expectations of the use case. It’s up to the manufacturer to
provide documentation for these services or not.

6.3

Characteristics

The actual data of services is contained in characteristics. Every characteristic belongs
to a specific service and has a value attached to it. However, it’s not because you
can see the characteristic, that you don’t need special rights to read or write it. A
characteristic can specify certain rights like read, write, read uncommitted (where no
23

CHAPTER 6. GENERIC ATTRIBUTE PROFILE
acknowledgement is sent for the write request) and more. This is something that
can be ignored, but an error message will be returned anyway if you try to read a
characteristic that isn’t readable. These permissions can be used to notify the user
interface that it shouldn’t allow the user to interact with certain characteristics.
If we take our trusty Heart Rate for example, the Heart Rate Measurement, we can
look at the data structure and how the value should be parsed. This characteristic also
has some “Flags” bits which indicate things like the data type of the value (UINT8 or
UINT16) and if certain fields are present or not. Depending on the Flags, there are a
couple of values to be found inside this characteristic: Heart Rate Measurement Value,
Energy Expended and RR-Interval.
As with services, custom characteristics can also be defined. A template characteristic can be used or the bit structure can be designed from the ground up to
accommodate the specific use case.

6.4

Descriptors

If we go down even further, we come to the descriptors. These can optionally accompany characteristics and describe the value of a given characteristic. The descriptors
can house very useful data like a description, a valid range of the data and a couple
more. If these descriptors are defined, it can greatly help with building up a user
interface by only allowing certain values or showing a description for a custom made
characteristic, but one shouldn’t rely on these descriptors as they’re not filled in more
often than not.

Why Bluetooth Low Energy and
Internet of Things
“I NEED TO LOOK UP A QUOTE
FOR THIS CHAPTER”
Jan Van Braeckel

The Internet of Things is quickly growing and it’s already huge, filled with both
long-range sensors using LoRa and Sigfox technologies and short-range sensors using
WiFi or directly connected with a gateway connected to internet. Why would it then
be beneficial to add another spectrum of devices: Bluetooth Low Energy? The main
reason for this is because no other technology fills this spectrum of devices yet. Right
now, you can compare wireless IOT technologies against 2 axis: power and range,
as seen in figure 7.1. Before Bluetooth Low Energy, there wasn’t really any major
technology to fill the Low Energy, Low Range spectrum. One can say that Zigbee or
other technologies could fill this end of the spectrum, but none of these are as widely
adopted as Bluetooth Low Energy is today. In this chapter we’ll further discuss the
use cases Bluetooth Low Energy can fulfil in this Low Power, Low Range spectrum as
well as briefly introducing its competitors, before ending with what the future holds
for Bluetooth Low Energy.

7.1

Uses of Bluetooth Low Energy

When looking at the adopted Bluetooth Low Energy profiles and services, as discussed
in sections 6.1 and 6.2, it’s quite easy to find some general use cases that the technology
can be used for. Some important use cases are listed below, but are surely not limited
to this list:
• Quantified Self, Sport and Fitness: Cycling Power, Cycling Speed and Cadence, Running Speed and Cadence, Body Composition, Heart Rate, Weight
Scale
• Health care: Blood Pressure, Glucose, Continuous Glucose Monitoring, Health
Thermometer, Heart Rate and Weight Scale, Pulse Oximeter
• Location and Proximity: Find Me, Location and Navigation, Proximity, Indoor
Positioning
Of course, once we include non-adopted specifications, the list could go on forever
with entries being added every day. For example, there’s the “Flower Power”1 device
which measures your plant health by monitoring air temperature, soil temperature, soil
moisture, soil electrical conductivity and more. It synchronizes with a smartphone that
has the Flower Power application paired to the device and synchronizes the data to an
online cloud at set intervals, where the data can then be queried with an API (closed
system as seen in figure 1.1). A lot of these services aren’t included in the adopted
specifications, so extending standard Bluetooth profiles with your own can greatly
1

26

CHAPTER 7. WHY BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY AND INTERNET OF THINGS
expand the possibilities of the technology. However, if the manufacturer doesn’t release
the specifications of their device, interoperability with existing apps or integrating that
device in other apps will be made very hard.
However, the Flower Power example isn’t exactly the best Bluetooth Low Energy
use case in existence. For example, what if there’s a gardener who plants some of
these devices in his/her customers’ yards. If the customer isn’t home for two weeks,
then there’s no cellphone to synchronize the data to and the gardener will have to
come over to check if the plants need care either way. Some people in the community
also thought this was a problem and made a NodeJS gateway application to run on
a Raspberry PI or other computer but the product wasn’t originally designed for this
and the NodeJS gateway leaves a lot to be desired.

7.2

Competitors

As the rules of marketing tell us, there aren’t (or there are very little) products that have
no significant competitors. While Bluetooth Low Energy is trumping its competitors
pretty well, it’s still worthwhile to look at the these other technologies and what they
do.

7.2.1

ZigBee

ZigBee has been designed from the ground up with automation in mind, as well as
Internet of Things. It’s not just focused on home automation, but it’s also used for
smart energy products, health care, equipment monitoring, remote controls and more.
Some major technology manufacturers have adopted this technology and are selling
home automation kits for people to set up in their homes, like Xiaomi with its Smart
Home kit. Another thing ZigBee does very well is mesh networking. Devices can be
connected with one another and exchange data without needing additional gateways
to fetch the data. However, the problem with ZigBee is that the platform is completely
open and changes can be made for it as the manufacturer wishes. So it might happen
that two devices with a ZigBee chip aren’t even able to communicate with one another.

7.2.2

Z-Wave

Another wireless technology that is built completely for home automation is Z-Wave.
The major difference between ZigBee and Z-Wave however, is that the Z-Wave technology isn’t open. This is both good and bad because it’s not open at all to development,
you simply take the technology as it comes and no flexibility is offered beyond that
point. For the consumer this is beneficial however, ensuring interoperability between
Z-Wave devices, since Z-Wave also features mesh networking.
27

CHAPTER 7. WHY BLUETOOTH LOW ENERGY AND INTERNET OF THINGS

7.2.3

ANT

ANT is another good example of a Bluetooth Low Energy competitor. This is again a
proprietary technology and was built with sensor networks in mind. It features powerful
mesh networking as well as star, tree and point-to-point networks, allowing all kind of
networks to be used in unison.

7.3

Other wireless technologies

There are loads of other technologies that can be used to power the Internet of Things,
but we won’t go too much in depth in these. Some of these technologies and protocols
are X10 (home automation), KNX (home automation) and M-bus (industry). Other
very big technologies, not necessarily in the Low Energy/Low Range spectrum are LoRa
(Long Range), GPRS (cellular) and Sigfox (Long Range).

7.4

Future of Bluetooth Low Energy

Bluetooth Low Energy has been an exciting technology from the start and is gaining popularity at a very rapid rate. While the Bluetooth 4.0 specification brought
Bluetooth Low Energy to life, some very much needed updates have made it to the
Bluetooth specification, which is now at version 4.2. Bluetooth 4.1 brought improved
consumer usability with better co-existence between Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth BR/EDR, as well as increased data exchange rate and more flexibility for the
developers. The 4.1 specification also brought IP-based connections to Bluetooth Low
Energy. In essence, a device can directly communicate over internet once it’s been
connected to a gateway that has internet access, like a smartphone.
The newest update, Bluetooth 4.2, brings yet more changes to the Bluetooth
specification. It brings improved speeds yet again, support for IPv6, 6LoWPAN (IPv6
over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks) and improved security.
The Bluetooth SIG is constantly working on Bluetooth Low Energy, and it has
been announced that the range would be significantly improved. They also brought
mesh networking to the table, just like ZigBee, Z-Wave and ANT. These improvements
will bring even more use cases to Bluetooth Low Energy, the main one being home
automation.

Concerns

A more concerning limitation is that Bluetooth Low Energy operates in the 2.4 GHz
ISM frequency band, the same band that WiFi uses. They’ve chosen this band because
the 2.4 GHz ISM band doesn’t require any licensing cost, contributing to the very low
chip cost of Bluetooth Low Energy devices. Luckily, Bluetooth Low Energy features an
excellent algorithm to avoid major interference from WiFi, as it will avoid any channel
that is being heavily used by other technologies.
